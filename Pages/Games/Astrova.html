        Astrova came from a workshopping session I had with some University peers after <a href="">Bunny Hop</a> was finished in development and I had 
        worked on a few miscellaneous projects, leaving me with a void when it came to game ideas, especially arcade ready game ideas.
        The ship sprite was repurposed from a pixel art competition I entered some years beforehand and the rest of the game's aesthetic was built around there!
        While the visuals are undeniably crude, I'm proud of how the game feel was accomplished and it remains one of if not the most popular game on the Arcademia arcades
        around The University of Lincoln!
