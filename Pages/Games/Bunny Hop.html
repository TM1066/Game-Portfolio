      <div class="game-description">
        Bunny Hop was the first game that I developed upon enrolling into my University and realising that there were various arcade machines in one of our buildings!
        <br></br>
        It was a great way for me to get back into the process of working on and sharing games! 
        While it's quite simple and concise, I feel it's a great game that came out more polished then I initially expected and always makes for a quick bit of fun before lectures!
        <br></br>
        My girlfriend also provided the bunny sprites, which gave me some valuable experience in directing/working with someone else to make a game more appealing!
