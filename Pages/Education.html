  <h3>OCR Level 2 IT Fundamentals - Distinction *</h3>
  When re-entering education, as I did not attend Secondary Schooling, I at first went through a level 2 course focused around the general area of IT, including some
  sparse though valuable experience programming which I found I took to immediately, later going on throughout the year to develop several games (<A href="https://sallow2.itch.io/arcane-aristocracy">Arcane Aristocracy</A> & <A href="https://sallow2.itch.io/thief">Thief</A>)
  and help the peers among the year that didn't find programming as enjoyable complete projects of their own!
  <h3>UAL Level 3 Games Design & Development - Distinction</h3>
  After completing my Level 2 Certification to high level, I immediately sought to specialise into games development specifically. Luckily, due to the reputation I had garnered
  for having completed some video game projects the year prior, I was welcomed very warmly into the Games Design & Development course wherein I deepend my skills considerably while also
  becoming more involved in several extra curricular pursuits within the college including joining the Student Union and starting my own Creative Writing Club!

  my time completing this course was less inherently productive in terms of completed video game projects, but I'm currently working on a more fleshed out version of my final project: "Polarity"
  which will be released on my itch.io page following completion!
