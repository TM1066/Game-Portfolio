    Hello! I'm a First Year Games Computing Student at the University of Lincoln. I formerly studied Games Design and Development at HSDC (Havant & South Downs College)
    <br></br>
    I've always had a deep passion for games, stemming, as it does for many, 
    from my many many years avidly consuming and playing them throughout my life for entertainment and meandering, though ultimately invaluable, artistic analysis and contentment.
    <br></br>
