    Hello! I'm a First Year Games Computing Student at the University of Lincoln. I formerly studied Games Design and Development at HSDC (Havant & South Downs College)
    <br></br>
    I've always had a deep passion for games, stemming, as it does for many, 
    from my many many years avidly consuming and playing them throughout my life for entertainment and meandering, though ultimately invaluable, artistic analysis and contentment.
    <br></br>
    This passion has driven me throughout my academic and professional career and continues to motivate me to create meaningful, fun experiences to this day!

    Chronologic is my current long term project! I released a Demo available to play on this website or on my Itch.io page for free which is still being updated!
